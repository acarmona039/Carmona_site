        <p> Hey, I'm Arelys Carmona, a visual artist who likes to make fanart. Through a variety of mediums, I explore feelings and experiences in my art.<br> I try to translate value into my art, whether it's an uncluttered scene or a moment-capturing picture. I appreciate you looking at my portfolio.  </p>

        <p>This website was made for class purposes only most of the things on it are not real, except the contact and the drawings..those are. <br> This website was made to kinda promote myself and was created on january 2024. A bit about myself i am 18 years old and have always love to draw ever since i was little.<br> I remember i was caught drawing on walls. My goal is to have a webite like this when im older so i can better my skills in promoting myself in a better and more efficient way.</p>

<h2>Materials and Commisions</h2>

<p>This may sound like an ad, but to visualize my ideas, I use a number of equipment, and Ohuhu markers are one of them. They have grown to be a vital part of the way I create.<br> I often find myself grabbing for these markers to add quality, and deep color to my artwork because of their amazing and changeable dual tips.<br> Ohuhu markers constantly provide the ability and quality I need to properly bring my ideas, whether I'm sketching precise details or mixing gradients...<br>I also frequently use ordinary lead pencils as the starting point for my creative projects. Their simple appearance hides their adaptability and reliability,<br> which makes it easy and precise for me to scribble and sketch out ideas.Art commissions are when someone asks an artist to create a specific piece of art for them.<br> The artist gets paid for making the art, and the client gets the artwork they asked for a win-win for both parties .</p>

<p>I am available to do commissions for price that can be negotiated. Please understand that the time in which I finish a commission can vary on what you ask for and the difficulty.</p>
